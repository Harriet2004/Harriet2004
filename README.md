## 💼 About Me

I’m a versatile developer with a strong foundation in **full-stack engineering**, **machine learning**, and **cloud-native systems**. My work spans diverse areas, from training deep learning models for cancer classification, to building scalable web platforms, to analyzing social media trends with NLP and graph theory.

I’m confident working across the entire stack — building APIs with Express, designing UIs in React, automating deployments on AWS, or developing ML pipelines with TensorFlow and scikit-learn. I thrive in projects where I can apply both technical depth and creative problem-solving to deliver real impact.
